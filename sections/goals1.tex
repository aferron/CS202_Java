\subsection{IMPORTANT}
If possible bring your own laptop to these labs so you can learn
to install and work with an IDE. A couple of popular IDEs for Java
development are IntelliJ and Eclipse. We recommend using IntelliJ
because of its robust ecosystem, intuitive interface, and reliability.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{steps}
   \item Research what IDE to install and complete the prelab by installing and configuring an IDE
   \item Experience using an IDE and tools it provides like the debugger, compilation, and Git integration
   \item Become familiar with the general Java vocabulary and idiomatic practices
   \item Experience implementing Java software starting with basic concepts like:
   \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
         \item I/O
         \item Primitive types
         \item Functionality of main
         \item Instantiating class objects
         \item Inheritance
         \item Recursion
      \end{enumerate}
   \item Complete the self check quizes as a knowledge check
   \item If everything is completed then move on to the optional advanced topics of:
   \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
         \item Useful usage of static and initialization blocks
         \item Using Java collections and iterators and creating your own generic types
         \item Interfaces versus Abstract Classes and psuedo-multiple inheritance
      \end{enumerate}
\end{steps}
